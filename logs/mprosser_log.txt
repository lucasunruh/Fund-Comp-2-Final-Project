Date		Time Spent		Accomplished
3/15		1.5 hours		Changed .cshrc file to automatically set path variables on startup.
					   Read first lesson of lazyfoo SDL2 tutorial. Ran the code from
					   the tutorial to make sure it worked on the student machine.

3/18		1 hour			Read and took notes on SDL2 tutorials during lab.

3/19		1/2 hour		Read and took notes on more SDL2 tutorials. Finished up to the 5th
					   tutorial.

3/22		1 hour			Read and took notes on SDL2 tutorials. Finished up to the 7th
					   tutorial.

3/24		2 hours			Worked on getting images on the screen using SDL2. Succeeded in
					   blitting a black background but was unable to get a second
					   image on top of that. After trying to make the background a
					   texture, began having multiple errors in entirely separate
					   functions. Errors change depending on whether the student
					   machines or the library machines are used.

3/25		1 hour			Worked more on blitting images. Without having changed the code,
					   got a new set of errors, so removed renderer and texture to
					   go back to just blitting surfaces. Same problem as before:
					   background blits, but ball does not (no errors, it just
					   doesn't appear on the screen). Attempting to optimize the
					   background surface results in a segmentation fault when
					   trying to optimize the ball image, which is in an entirely
					   different function.

4/7		1.5 hours		Wrote Cursor.h, then began work on Cursor.cpp. Created the sprites
					   to be used for the cursor and the main character.

4/18		1.5 hours		Created 6 new character classes and sprite sheets for each.

4/22		1 hour			Added a way to prevent characters from occupying the same space to
					   the check_valid_move function. The changes didn't work, but are
					   at least a good start.

4/24
