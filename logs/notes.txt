Make sprites at: http://www.famitsu.com/freegame/tool/chibi/index1.html
	- Generates transparent sprite sheets in png format

Class implementation:
	- Base class: game piece
	   ~ has xpos, ypos, and pure virtual draw function, move function
		- Cursor
		   ~ has images of cursor
		- Character
		  ~ has loadimage, draw functions, and an array/vector for its movement info
			- Good guy
			   ~ has move function, sprite sheet depending on class, data members indicating which sprite to pick and how to pick it
			- Bad guy
			   ~ has move function, sprite sheet depending on class, data members indicating which sprite to pick and how to pick it


Picking a path:
 - The sprite move class should have a function to take the player's input determining the character's path and use the input to generate
   a vector that would be passed to a Good guy's move function, telling it how to move. Range could be controlled by using an algorithm to check
   the maximum range a character could move in any direction, then letting the player move the character to any tile within that range.
Possible algorithm:
 - Recursive function that moves up, right, down, left, recursively moving outward as far as it can based on the character's movement.
 - Pseudocode:
-------
checkmove(x, y, movecount)
	checkmove(up)
		x+1, y, movecount - [some value determined by the map]

Base case:
	if(x, y == illegal)
		...
	else if(move == 0)
		return
--------


The map:
- Regular terrain will have movement weight 1
- Water will 

Week of 4/6:
- Chris will write the Checkmove function for the character class to see the possible movements for characters [checkmove(x, y, moveinfo)]
- Tim will write the Game Piece and Cursor classes
- Mason will make the cursor images and hero sprites and help Tim with the classes
- Lucas will be helping Chris
Next meeting: Wednesday, 4/8
