Date            Time            Work Done                                       Learned

3/10/15         1               Lazy Foo tutorial 1. Worked with                A new path had to be added to PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
                                PATH vairalbes to allow for SDL                 Learned that the header #include <SDL2/SDL.h> must be included
                                compilation. Opened a white window,             at the beginning of the file - not simple <SDL.h> as Lazy Foo
                                and created this document to keep               says. Learned simple SDL concepts such as loading windows and
                                track of work done on the projec              surfaces, and getting SDL errors.

3/14/15         1               Lazy Foo tutorial 2. Loaded a BMP               More basic SDL functions. Learned the concepts of blitting and
                                image to a screen. Wrote a program              updating windows. Question: is there a way to upload images
                                named sdl2.cpp that opens a window              via terminal or is webfile the best way to do it? In tutorial
                                with a downloaded BMP image. Lazy Foo           I learned about the SDL_Event class and how SDL_PollEvent is
                                tutorial 3. Wrote program sdl3.cpp              used to process events such as keyboard, mouse, and joystick.
                                that loads the BMP image from last              The program now opens and window with an image and it stays
                                tutorial and displays it until the user         there until the user pressed the "x" on the corner.
                                presses the x on the window.
